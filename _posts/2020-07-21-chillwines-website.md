# Chillwines

<img src="/img/projects/chillwines/home-large.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto;" alt="Chillwines">

Chillwines strive to bring their clients a collection of unique premium South African wines direct to the United Kingdom through their website [www.chillwines.co.uk][chillwines]. The wine estates they represent are carefully chosen to offer clients the very best value, quality and variety.

## Chillwines Digital Strategy

[Chillwines][chillwines] commissioned 22 Digital in _April 2018_ to design and launch their online website. Our strategy was to focus the delivery of the project in three distinct project phases. 

The first phase would encompass the **website design**, **[Shopify](https://link.22digital.co.za/shopify-chillwines "Shopify Store Setup and Config") store setup** and configuration, and the initial product **integration into social media** platforms.

The second phase, delivered in _July 2019_, focused on the **Usability and User Experience (UX)** as well as the **Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)** of the website. In this phase we worked on improving the website content, layout of the website, and improve the purchase process to ensure maximum sales and conversions.

The third phase (which remains ongoing) was the launch of a fully-fledged **digital marketing campaign** set for launch in _July 2020_. The launch of this campaign was imperative to ensuring scale and growth for the [Shopify](https://link.22digital.co.za/shopify-chillwines "Shopify Developer") store and drive Return on Investment (ROI) for Chillwines.

### Phase One: Website Launch

A key objective for Chillwines was their need for a cost-effective, easy-to-use, ecommerce platform to enable them to sell their premium South African wines to customers in the United Kingdom. As a [Shopify Partner](https://link.22digital.co.za/shopify-chillwines "Shopify Partner") it became clear to us at 22 Digital that a [Shopify website](https://link.22digital.co.za/shopify-chillwines "Shopify Website Designer") would be the best solution.

This is a breakdown of the service offering during this first phase:

- Competitor and SWOT analysis.
